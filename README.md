# React Jobs

A full CRUD website for finding React developer jobs.

<img src="public/screen.png" />

The **general layout and most naming convention of the project** draw inspiration from the design presented in Traversy Media's React jobs tutorial. However, the underlying implementation, application logic (including the `services` folder and `custom fetch hook`...etc), dark mode functionality and other enhancements/ additions (planned), and other unique features are my original work.
